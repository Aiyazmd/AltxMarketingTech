                        <p>We are spectacular colleagues to our clients and partners.</p>
                        <p>We aim to be the first call with good news and, perhaps more importantly,
                            a safe harbor for other news. When storms roll in, because they do, our
                            partners toss us the line
                            and know that we will toast success when the seas have settled.</p>

                        <h4>Possibility Rules</h4>
                        <p>Positive by nature, we spring into action around what is possible. </p>
                        <p>Add a dash of feasibility (see EBITDA credentials) but leave pessimism at the door. </p>
                        <p>We control how we show up every day. </p>

                        <h4>What’s Around That Corner?!</h4>
                        <p>Curiosity breeds creativity and mitigates risk. We like to peak around corners,
                            look under the rocks and kick a few tires. </p>
                        <p>Asking “the question” helps distinguish between shiny
                            objects and the real deal. </p>

                        <p>It makes us great business partners and excellent party guests! </p>
